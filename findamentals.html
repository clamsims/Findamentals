        <h3><sup>1</sup> Debt Clearing</h3>
        <h3 class="topic-desc">Getting rid of any debt as quickly
as possible is very important.</h3>
        <div class="topic-content">
          <p>There are a few steps you can take to rid yourself of any debt, you should always make the minimum repayment on any loans or credit cards you have taken out providing you have enough money left over after paying your living expenses.
<span class="hl">(If this is not the case it is recommended that you seek debt counselling from a reputable charity such as <a href="stepchange.org.uk">stepchange.org.uk</a>)</span>
</p>
</br>
<h3>High Interest Debts <span class="subhead">(>4% pa excl. student loans)</span></h3>
</br>
<p>These debts should be paid off first, there are two methods you can use do this, commonly known as <span class="term">Avalanche</span> and <span class="term">Snowball</span>.</p>
</br>
<p><span class="term">Avalanche</span> tackles the highest debt first (the one that is costing you the most/highest interest rate) making it the more efficient method, however it usually requires giving up a lot more of your spending.
The aim is to pay as much back as you can as soon as you can on your high interest debt leaving you with the peace of mind that your other debts are smaller and will be easier to pay back in comparison.
If you don't have the mindset for saving this may be a tougher option from a mental standpoint, and you may prefer the next option.</p>
</br>
<p><span class="term">Snowballing</span> your debt is the inverse of the previously mentioned method, its more of a step by step method focusing on paying off the smaller debts first, which should in turn give you the motivation to pay off any other debts getting incrementally larger until there is none left.
However this method is less efficient as your larger debts are costing you more in interest as you pay off the smaller ones.</p>
